# BookCore-Insights-Using-SQL

BookCore Insights using SQL is a data analytics project designed to analyze an online bookstore’s operations using SQL. The project focuses on extracting meaningful business insights from three core tables: Books, Customers, and Orders. By applying SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced levels, this project explores sales performance, customer behavior, revenue trends, genre popularity, and inventory status.

**Database Structure**

Books: Stores book details such as title, author, genre, price, published year, and stock availability.
Customers: Contains customer information including name, country, and contact details.
Orders: Captures transaction data such as order date, quantity, total amount, and references to books and customers.

**Tools & Techniques Used**

SQL joins to combine data across multiple tables
Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG) for sales and revenue analysis
GROUP BY and HAVING for segmentation and filtering insights
Subqueries and DISTINCT for advanced filtering
Analytic functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK) for ranking and trend analysis
Date functions to analyze yearly and monthly order patterns

**Key Insights Generated**

Identification of top-selling and least-selling books
Analysis of total and average revenue
Most popular genres based on quantity sold
High-value customers and their spending behavior
Order trends across different years and months
Inventory analysis to identify low-stock books

**Project Objective**

The main objective of this project is to strengthen SQL querying skills while simulating real-world business scenarios. It demonstrates how SQL can be used to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.
